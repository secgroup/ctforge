<h1>CTF Rules</h1>
<p>
    WUTCTF2.0 is a security competition for students attending the <a href="https://tuwel.tuwien.ac.at/course/view.php?id=17665">Introduction to Security (VU, 184.783)</a> and <a href="https://tuwel.tuwien.ac.at/course/view.php?id=21976">Introduction to Security (UE, 192.082)</a> courses at <a href="https://tuwien.ac.at">TU Wien</a>. Please refer to <a href="https://tuwel.tuwien.ac.at">TUWel</a> pages for more information including lectures, deadlines and grading rules.
</p>


<h3>Flags</h3>
<p>
    The aim of each challenge is to get a string (called flag) that proves a successful exploitation. Flag format is <code>wut{...}</code> unless differently specified.
</p>


<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>
    Each challenge is worth a certain amount of points that should reflect the expected difficulty level. After submitting a flag, you are expected to write a report, called write-up, and submit it using the provided form within a limited amount of time that is announced when a challenge is released. The CTF platform provides a template for every write-up, asking for specific details on the solution and eventually to submit some code. <strong>Write-ups not following the template will not be evaluated</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Students can voluntarily decide to solve challenges of one set even if they are not enrolled in the relative course, but the additional points will not affect the final grade. On the other hand, their rank in the scoreboard will be higher!
</p>


<h3>Technical and Human Behaviour</h3>
<p>We'd like everyone to enjoy a fair game. For this reason we ask you to follow these simple rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No attacks against the infrastructure (this website and challenges) including denial-of-service (DoS), floods, DNS poisoning, ARP spoofing, MITM, etc... The CTF platform is <a hreaf="https://github.com/secgroup/ctforge">open source</a> and we welcome everyone to perform a securty review of its source code. Report us any vulnerability you may find for an additional bonus!</li>
    <li>Don't try to bruteforce flags by doing an unreasonable number of attempts in the flag submission page. We guarantee our flags to be unguessable&trade;.</li>
    <li>Vulnerability/network scanners are useless for these challenges and not allowed. Do something better.</li>
    <li>If you find a way to hack into a service/challenge more easily than intended, please report it to the tutors.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Rules anyway may change as more issues are raised by the participants. Also, the organizers keep the right to change them at any time. Keep in mind that it is not possible/feasible to list all the rules and the exceptions to rules that apply to the CTF competition. When in doubt, use common sense or ask the tutors/teaching assistants.
</p>


<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>
    For any challenge, you can use all resources listed on the website and in TUWEL lecture notes, referred textbooks, and URLs mentioned on the slides and in the challenge description. It is strictly prohibited to use solutions/code from similar courses or to take solutions/code from Internet searches. If you discuss with other people, list them (i.e., cite your sources) and indicate how your solution was affected by that discussion.
</p>
<p>
    Solutions have to be kept strictly confidential: spreading of information is easy to detect and it will likely spoil the fun of other participants trying to solve the tasks. In case of uncertainty, ask the tutors or teaching assistants. There is no warning: if you are caught cheating, you might be banned from the course.
</p>


<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>
    Please use the forums hosted on TUWel if you have doubts about the challenges or if you need clarification on a specific topic. If you think you have any question or request that cannot be publicly shared, send us a mail at <a href="mailto:introsec@list.tuwien.ac.at">introsec@list.tuwien.ac.at</a>.
</p>


<h3>Credits</h3>
<p>
    The CTF platform, the gaming infrastructure and most challenges have been designed by <a href="https://minimalblue.com">Marco Squarcina</a> and <a href="https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/mauro-tempesta">Mauro Tempesta</a> based on previous work for the Security course at <a href="https://www.unive.it/">Università Ca' Foscari</a> and for the <a href="https://cyberchallenge.it/">CyberChallenge.IT</a> training program. Lorenzo Veronese contributed to the CTF platform and to the infrastructure. The tutors tested all the challenges before release and provided useful feedback.
