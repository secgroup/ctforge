The DCTF 2019 is a security competitions for students who attend the Security course at Ca' Foscari University. It is organized by the c00kies@venice hacking team under the direction of prof. Riccardo Focardi. 

Network and Setup
-----------------
The game is played within the `10.0.0.0/16` subnet. Each team has its own vulnerable machine located at `10.0.<team_id>.1`, while players connecting to the game network are assigned an ip in the range `10.0.<team_id>.150` - `10.0.<team_id>.200`. All vulnerable VMs will be hosted by organisers and will have enough resources in terms of CPU and memory to run the pre-installed services. Scoreboard is reachable at [http://10.0.254.2/](http://10.0.254.2/) or [http://dctf-ad.seclab.dais.unive.it/](https://dctf-ad.seclab.dais.unive.it/).

![Network Map](/static/img/netowrk-map.png)

The _gameserver_ is responsible for dispatching flags to the vulnerable machines, checking services integrity, hosting the scoreboard and updating scores. Participants are asked to attack vulnerable machines of other teams to retrieve proofs of successful exploitation (flags). Flags must be submitted to the flag submission service hosted by the organisers to score points. At the same time, teams must defend the vulnerable services installed on their VMs. Teams can do whatever they want within their network segment.

The VMs are *not* connected to the Internet. The only allowed traffic is towards the
ubuntu mirrors to make you download additional software. Everything else must be copied
manually using ssh.
        
Beware that if you mess up your vulnerable machine, all we can do is reset it to its original state (backup your exploits, tools and patches!).

There are ssh backup keys deployed by organisers on all vulnerable boxes. Do not remove them!  
The legitimate keys are:

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIAhsiDAURnGrsGf0D64FBxf8Q2Jo7TwcCj0v9q5sjkUT root@manager_master.ctf.secgroup.dsi.unive.it
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIF2fiOwOSl52KZN43OimLmAN9K4WEr6Q8Y6V/l8VUMmH flagbot@manager_master.ctf.secgroup.dsi.unive.it
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGz26Wuq8f0B9FwPx9M/kdEReWqQy+SqTUWCs83lZKKe root@seclab
```

Scoring
-------
The game is divided in _rounds_ (also called _ticks_) having the duration of 120 seconds. During each round, a bot will add new flags to your vulnerable machine. Moreover it will check the integrity of services by interacting with them and by retrieving the flags through a legitimate accesses. 

Your team gains points by attacking other teams, defending its own vulnerable machine and by keeping services up and running. The total score is the sum of the individual scores for each service. The score per service is made up of three components:

* Offense: Points for flags captured from other teams and submitted to the gameserver within their validity period
* Defense: Points for not letting other teams capture your flags
* SLA: Points for the availability and correct behavior of your services

For each service, the component scores for a team are calculated as in this Python-like pseudocode:

### Offense

```Python
offense = count(flags_captured_by[team])
for flag in flags_captured_by[team]:
offense += (1 / count(all_captures_of[flag]))
```

### Defense

```Python
defense = 0
for flag in flags_owned_by[team]:
defense -= sqrt(count(all_captures_of[flag]))
```

### SLA

```Python
sla = count(ticks_with_status['up']) * sqrt(count(teams))
```

### Total Score

```Python
total = 0
for service in services:
total += offense[service] + defense[service] + sla[service]
```

For each team, the scoreboard will list the offense, defense and SLA points of each service and the total score. Additionally, the number of conquered and lost flags will be displayed. The status of each service will also be included in the scoreboard along with the timestamp of the last check performed by the bots. The possible status values are:

* _up_: service is online and behaves as expected
* _corrupt_: service could be offline or broken, eventually as a result of a wrong patch that compromised the intended functionalities of the service or the checker could not confirm the presence of a valid flag
* _not checked_: the checker running on the gameserver has not yet verified the status of the service

Since there are countless ways to break a service, the scoreboard will not provide additional information if a service is marked as corrupt. Try to restore the service from your backup (please do it before applying patches) and check if the service is marked as `up` again in a few minutes.


Flags
-----
A flag is a string made up of 25 alphanumeric chars enclosed by `{` and `}`, prefixed by `flg`. Each flag is matched by the regular expression `flg\{[a-zA-Z0-9]{25}\}`. 

To manually submit a flag, click on the _flag submission service_ option in the top-right menu of the CTF portal after logging-in and enter the flag in the input form. During the CTF, anyway, you may want to automatically submit flags. To do so, you can submit stolen flags by performing an HTTP POST request to the gameserver at `10.0.254.2`. The request must contain the keys `flag` and `team_token`, where the value of the first entry is the stolen flag and `team_token` is a string that allows the server to identify your team. The token of your team can be found in your _team page_ on the CTF portal.

**Important: do not perform user authentication while submitting flags, this is not needed and may overload our servers**.

As an example, we provide a simple python snippet that accounts for the submission of an hardcoded flag.

```Python
#!/usr/bin/python
import requests

url = 'http://10.0.254.2/submit'
team_token = '<your_token>'
stolen_flag = 'flg{abcdefghilmnopqrstuvz0123}'

r = requests.post(url, data={'team_token': team_token, 'flag': stolen_flag})
```

Flags are considered expired after 5 rounds. It means that teams have up to 10 minutes to steal a flag and submit it. At the same time, the check bot will try to retrieve one of the last 5 flags from a service to check if the intended functionalities have been preserved and mark it as _up_.

Technical and Human Behaviour
-----------------------------
We'd like everyone to enjoy a fair game. For this reason we ask you to follow these simple rules:

* No attacks against the infrastructure including denial-of-service (DoS), floods, DNS poisoning, ARP spoofing, MITM, etc...
* The only permitted attack targets are the vulnerable machines! Players are not allowed to attack each other (e.g., you can't break into rivals' laptops)
* Destructive behavior and unfair practices are severely prohibited. These include removing flags or deleting files on compromised hosts, creating fake flags to break legitimate attacks
* Network vulnerability scanners - with the exception of a few manual runs of `nmap` - are not allowed, do something better
* Sharing flags, exploits or hints between teams is severely prohibited and will grant you the exclusion from the competition.

Before attempting to break one of the aforementioned rules, remember that all the network traffic is logged. Violations to these rules will be evaluated by the organisers who reserve the right to penalize or exclude teams and individual from the competition.


Communication
-------------

We invite everyone attending the contest to join us on slack. It will be the main platform for the interaction with the organizers. 

And remember to...

...have fun and hack all the things!!!!!11
