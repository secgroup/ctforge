<h1>CTF Rules</h1>
<p>
    The DCTF 2019 is a security competitions for students who attend the <a href="https://www.unive.it/data/insegnamento/274860">Security course</a> at Ca' Foscari University.
    It is organized by the <a href="https://secgroup.github.io">c00kies@venice</a> hacking team under the direction of prof. Riccardo Focardi.
</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>
    The contest is expected to continue for the entire duration of the course.<br>
    In each lab session a new challenge will be released and a discussion on the problem will take place on the course Slack.
</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>
    Each challenge is worth a certain amount of points in the range <code>0-500</code> according to the expected difficulty.
    Besides solving the challenges, you are expected to write a small report and submit it using the provided form
    within a limited amount of time (usually a week), that will be announced at the release of every challenge.
    The CTF platform will provide a template for every writeup, asking for particular details an/or the submission of the code.
    <u>The writeups that do not follow the template will not be evaluated</u>.
</p>
<p>
    After the submission of the writeup you will be assigned a grade (0 or 1) and a feedback on the solution.
    Every positively graded challenge will grant a <b>bonus</b> on the exam score of <code>0.5</code> points.
</p>
<p>
    Before solving any of the other challenges, you are required to accept an <code>agreement</code> on the responsible use of the abilities
    you will acquire during this lab.
</p>

<h3>Flags</h3>
<p>
    The aim of each challenge is to get a string (called flag) that proves a successful exploitation.
    All flags will have different formats but they will be easily recognizable.
</p>

<h3>Technical and Human Behaviour</h3>
<p>We'd like everyone to enjoy a fair game. For this reason we ask you to follow these simple rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No attacks against the infrastructure (this website and challenges) including denial-of-service (DOS), floods, DNS poisoning, ARP spoofing, MITM, etc...</li>
    <li>Don't try to bruteforce flags by doing an unreasonable number of attempts in the flag submission page. We guarantee our flags to be unguessable&trade;.</li>
    <li>Vulnerability/network scanners are useless for these challenges and not allowed. Do something better.</li>
    <li>If you find a way to hack into a service/challenge more easily than intended, please report it to the organizers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Rules anyway may change as more issues are raised by the participants. Also, the organizers keep the right to change them at any time.
    Keep in mind that it is not possible/feasible to list all the rules and the exceptions to rules that apply to the CTF competition. When in doubt, use common sense or ask to us on slack.
</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>
    We invite everyone attending the contest to join us on slack. <br>
    Challenge discussion will happen there and it will be the main platform for the interaction with the organizers.
</p>

<h3>And remember to...</h3>
<p>...have fun and hack all the things!!!!!11</p>
